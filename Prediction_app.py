         - Landslides are the cataclysmic events due to mass movements of rock, debris, or earth down the slope under the influence of gravity, resulting in a geomorphic change of the earthâ€™s surface. They co-occur with other natural disasters like flood, volcanoes and earthquakes, incurring more environmental damages and fatalities
         - Landslide may occur based on several triggering factors such as slope failure, high precipitation, road and other construction works etc
         - Many regions of western ghat such as Kodagu, Kerala and Himalayan regions of India have witnesses severe landslides causing fatalities and destructions all over the area
         - Between 1998-2017, landslides affected an estimated 4.8 million people and cause more than 18,000 deaths all over the world

         - Landslide displacement prediction is important part of the monitoring and early warning systems. Effective prediction is instrumental in reducing the risk of landslide disaster

         - Landslide Prediction System helps to predict the landslides that can occur based on several landslide triggering factors
         - Building a Landslide Prediction System not only helps to reduce fatalities, but also to make a proper urban planning and to take  the precautionary measures
