# Landslide-Prediction
Landslides are one of several natural hazards. As other natural hazards, landslides are difficult to predict, and their forecasts are uncertain. The uncertainty depends on poor understanding of the phenomena that control the slope failure, and on the inherent complexity. Predicting Landslides using Machine learning also involves certain problems such as model selection, model training and finally building an effective predictive system.

Models used for analysis:
 1) KNN
 2) SVM
 3) Random Forest
 4) Decision Tree

Finally a model with better accuracy is chosen to build the predictive system.
